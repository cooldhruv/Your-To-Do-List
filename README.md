# Your-To-Do-List
It's a simple web application that contains a to-do list generator along with a smart management system to 
manage between your pending tasks and your complete tasks.

When you add a new task, it gets added to the list of pending tasks, but once it's get completed by the user it's status 
can be changed from pending to completed by moving it from the list of pending tasks to the list of completed tasks

If the user changes his/her mind, to make some changes in the tasks he/she completed or wish to repeat the task they can
change the status of task from completed to pending tasks again.

So in this way this web application gives user a freedom to his shuffle his/her tasks between pending and completed task's list.

The lists will also remain unaffected even after several reloads and other functions, but will clear up once the user tabs 
refresh and gives his/her final concent for it.
